# Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN

This is **Task 4** of my internship at *Skill Craft Technology*.  
To build a real-time hand gesture recognition system using CNN that can accurately detect and classify different hand gestures from image data (LeapGestRecog dataset), and demonstrate the effectiveness of gesture-based human-computer interaction.

Project Features
- Trained on 20000+ gesture images
- Real-time image classification
- Achieved 95%+ validation accuracy
- Clean, modular Google Colab code
- Ready for deployment via Streamlit
- Well-documented and GitHub-friendly

Dataset
This project uses the [LeapGestRecog](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog)

**Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size.
